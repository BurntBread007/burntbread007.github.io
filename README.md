Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! I'm BurntBread007-- Bread for short-- and here I compiled a portfolio of all my produced works.
I dive into various tech fields, enjoy silly cats, and often spend my time studying or in VR. While I may be nowhere as advanced or experienced as other quirky 'githubbers', I hope you can enjoy my work regardless.

My listed fields of work are listed below: (click to jump)

- [Programming](#programming),
- [3D Modeling](#3d-modeling),
- [Videogames: VR & Retro Collecting](#gaming)
- [More Stuff](#contact-info)

## **Programming**

- **General Programming**; `1 year Python`, 2020-2021
- **AP Computer Science**; `1 year JS, 1 year Java`, 2019-2021
- **Self-guided stuff in Unity** `C#`, 2020-Present (on and off)
- **Computer Science Courses @ FIT**; `1 year Java`, 2023-Present

## **Programming Projects**

### **1. [Gex Discord Bot](https://github.com/furryinstitute/Gex-Discord-Bot)**

- Made an interactive Discord bot themed around a late 90s videogame platformer protagonist, Gex the Gecko. Serves multiple functions, from conversating with users via GP4All to blurting out quips when text channels get heated.
- Largest project to-date with an ever-changing scope.

### **2. [Java-IM](https://github.com/BurntBread007/Java-IM)**

Example screenshot of a group chat within Java-IM (v0.1.6):

- Uses Java's Threads feature to read and broadcast messages sent between client programs and a host server program. Made simple as a concept for **fast and lightweight communication**.

### **3. [FunkyXML](https://github.com/BurntBread007/Funkin-XML-Editor)** (also on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/tools/7032))

- Tool for the game Friday Night Funkin. Made in Python, this handles the grunt work that would be otherwise left to the game's custom creators; this program removes that burden by calculating and editing the coordinate data on a character's .XML file based on the creator's desired character size.

- This video shows the main character of the game replaced by the spritesheet, seen below.

- After the user enters the character's size, a grid of boxes is created with the animation types in each cell. All that's left for users is to drag-and-drop their character's drawn frames into each box using any image editing software! Once done, the game will use this program's edited lines and custom spritesheet to work near-seamlessly.

## **3D Modeling**

- **3D "Animation"**; `2 years Premiere Pro + After Effects + bit of Maya`, 2021-2023
- **Self-guided Blender**; `Miscelleanous projects`, 2019-Present (on and off)

## **Modeled Creations**

## **Gaming**

- **VR Gamer**: `Windows Mixed Reality` 2020-2021, `Rift CV1` 2021-Present
- **Competitve Beat Saber**: `Best Rank #2500 Worldwide, Top 1.00%`, July 2020-May 2022 (slowly dropping off :c )
- **Retro Game Collecter**: `GameCube, OG XBox, SNES, N64`, May 2020-Present
![WIP Xbox 360 Mod](/assets/images/burntbread_xbox360.jpg)
- I have also delved into the world of **soldering** and **console modding** to modify this Xbox 360! I re-soldered its fans to a 12V rail for more power, which helps prevent overheating/RROD; but more importantly, I hydro-dipped for extra swag.

## **Beat Saber Videos/Ranking**

- Created in 2018, Beat Saber is a rhythm game developed for Virtual Reality. Each of your controllers wield a saber, each with a different color. As music plays, blocks float into view with predetermined arrows and timing on them, requiring the player to swing each saber into every block of its corresponding color, arrow direction, and specific time.
In practice, this creates a competitive game that can ask for speedy and exerting physical work, **requiring skills such as: quick reflexes, arm/wrist flexibility, and cardio and arm endurance, and many more skills.**

Personal best rank on ScoreSaber in September 2021, peaking at:

- ~#1000 U.S.
- ~#2500 Worldwide
- Top 1.00% of all ScoreSaber players

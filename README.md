Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm BurntBread007-- Bread for short-- and here I compile a portfolio of all my works achieved via my dense box of metals and rocks.
I am 18 years old, diving into any and all tech fields, swag cat enjoyer, and that one person who ironically obsesses over Among Us. While I feel I am nowhere as advanced or experienced as the other quirky githubbers, I hope you can enjoy my work regardless.
- My listed fields of work are listed below: (click on these to jump)
- [Programming](#Programming), 
- [3D-modeling](#3d-modeling), 
- [Videogames: VR & Retro collecting](#gaming)

## **Programming**
- 1 year **Python Programming**, 2020-2021
- 2 years **AP CS**; `1 year JS, 1 year Java`, 2019-2021
- Self-guided **scripting/development in Unity** _(C#)_, 2020-Present

## **Programming Projects**

### **1. [FunkyXML](https://github.com/BurntBread007/Funkin-XML-Editor)** on GitHub and [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/tools/7032)
- Made as a tool for the then-popular game Friday Night Funkin. Made in Python, this handles the grunt work that would be otherwise left to the game's custom creators. Adding custom characters of any size requires edits to thousands of lines in .XML files, however this program removes that burden by calculating and editing every line based on the creator's desired character size. At its peak, it became the **~3rd most popular modding tool for the game** on GameBanana, and as of 11/19/2022, sits at **28K views and 2.5K** downloads.

- This video shows the main character of the game replaced by the spritesheet, seen below the video. This program had changed each line of its corresponding .XML file to match the dimensions of the custom "character".

- After the user enters the character's size, a grid of boxes is created, each labeled with the type of animation the character is in on that given cell. The only step left for users is to drag-and-drop their character's drawn frames into each box using any image editing software! Once done, the game will use this program's edited lines and custom spritesheet to work nearly seamlessly.


### **2. [Java-IM](https://github.com/BurntBread007/Java-IM)** on GitHub

- Written in Java, I use the threads feature to read and broadcast messages sent between client programs and the host server program. Made simple as a concept for **fast and lightweight communication**. Unsure of public statistics since I do not market this project, I still mess with it now and then with friends.

## **3D Modeling**
- 2 years **3D "Animation"**; `Premiere Pro + After Effects + little bit of Maya`, 2021-Present (2nd year is in progress)
- **Self-guided Blender**, 2019-Present (on and off)

## **Gaming**
- **VR gamer**; `Windows Mixed Reality 2020-2021`, `Rift CV1 2021-Present`
- **Competitve Beat Saber**; `Best Rank #2500 Worldwide, Top 1.00%`, July 2020-May 2022
- **Retro Game Enjoyer**; `GameCube, OG XB, XB360, N64`, Collecting May 2020-Present
- **Game Mods**; Within miscellaenous games including Super Mario 64, Bonelab, & VRChat. No mods have been publicly published, but I have tinkered enough to make smaller/personal mods.
![WIP Xbox 360 Mod](/assets/images/burntbread_xbox360.jpg)
- I have also delved into the world of **soldering** and **console modding** to modify this Xbox 360! I re-soldered its fans to a 12V rail for more power, which helps prevent overheating/RROD, and I plan to continue more QoL mods to make this sleek and more usable. But most obviously, I hydro-dipped for extra swag.


## **Beat Saber Videos/Ranking**
- Created in 2018, Beat Saber is a rhythm game developed for Virtual Reality. Each of your controllers wield a saber, each with a different color. As music plays, blocks float into view with predetermined arrows and timing on them, requiring the player to swing each saber into every block of its corresponding color, arrow direction, and specific time. In practice, this creates a competitive game that can ask for speedy and exerting physical work, **requiring skills such as: quick reflexes, arm/wrist flexibility, and cardio and arm endurance, and many more skills.**

- Here is an example of a moderately difficult level during my competitive reign. The view you see is that of the headset I wear, and each saber accurately represents the swings of each of my arms. At intense speeds such as this, I have maintained burns of up to **~12 kcal/min**.

- I hit my personal rank record on 9/6/2021, topping at **~#1000 U.S., ~#2500 Worldwide, and overall the Top 1.00% of competitive players.**
